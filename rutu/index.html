          <h2>MC Mary Kom</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Chungneijang Mary Kom Hmangte, popularly known as MC Mary Kom, has been one of India’s leading sporting superstars over the last two decades.

                Be it her six women’s world championship titles or the bronze medal from the 2012 Olympic Games, there’s barely any accolade to elude this boxing legend.
                
                As Mary Kom bowed out in the Round of 16 at the Tokyo Olympics - likely her last appearance at the Games - here's a look at everything that ‘Magnificent Mary’ has achieved in the boxing ring so far.
                Kom has since won a medal at all eight AIBA World Boxing Championships since its inception in 2001 (six golds, a silver and a bronze, most recently in 2019), risen to world No.1 in the AIBA world rankings for a flyweight, and competed at the London 2012 Olympic Games, winning a bronze medal after being beaten by eventual champion Nicola Adams. It was India's first-ever Olympic medal in women's boxing.

Mary Kom missed the boat to Rio 2016 but managed to qualify for Tokyo 2020, which was her final appearance at the Summer Games.
